# ArchUnit Demo

This is a simple project that I use to demonstrate the usage and easiness of the
architecture testing library [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/).

You'll find the examples provided by ArchUnit itself [here](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit-Examples).

## Note

Some tests are expected to *fail* to show how the violations of architecture rules are reported.
